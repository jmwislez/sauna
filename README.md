# Building an outside sauna from scratch

## What this repository provides

In this repository, you'll find 3D designs for an external sauna, as well as for a shower.  It also provides materials and costs (2013 in Belgium), as well as pictures during building.

## The layout and dimensions

The sauna was to be installed outside, under an existing 3m x 3m hood of a garden shed.  A stabilized platform was already available.  

The available volume under the hood was the main driving factor for the dimensions.  Within these limitations, I searched for an optimal layout with minimal inner dimensions (to reduce the volume and hence heating costs).  I am quite satisfied with the selected layout, as it makes good use of the available space.

For the height, this meant one bench at 42cm height (typical ergonomic sitting height), one at 84cm (to sit with feet on the lower bench), and then a sitting height of XXcm (within XX% percentile).  Not much vertical space was left, so the floor and ceiling isolation thickness were limited to 10cm only.

For the width and depth, XXX

## Construction

The construction is based on a wood skeleton, which was assembled wall by wall in a workshop.  

These are the layers for the walls (from inside to outside):
* Inner wood finishing.
* Reflective waterproof layer (integrated with the glasswool), finished with aluminium tape.
* 15cm glasswool, carried by the wood skeleton.
* Thin XXX plates for covering the glasswool.
* Vapour shield layer.
* Air layer.
* External wood finishing.

For reasons of accessibility, the top and bottom structures were fully outfitted with reflective layer, glasswool and vapour shield before installation, while the side walls were outfitted once installed.


# Using the sauna

The sauna is comfortable for 2-3 people lying down, and up to 6-7 people sitting.  

Heating at 6 kW takes about 45-60 minutes, after which the heater duty cycle is around 50%.

# What I would do differently

* If room is available, increase the isolation thickness everywhere to 20cm.
* I would make it slightly wider, to avoid leggs colliding when 2 people are lying down on the top benches.
